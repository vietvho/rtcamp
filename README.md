- Explaination:
	+ I using Awesome Weather Widget that support Search City. If I build it I need registration Google PlaceApi which is required the Credit Card  Number. I don't add Icons like the design because we don't have enough icon for all status weather. So I kept default Icons of plugins.
	+ The Theme options http://rtcamp.warrennguyen.ga/wp-admin/customize.php?return=%2Fwp-admin%2F
	+ Page option that overwrite ThemeOptions at each Page
	+ I built myself all the other things like All Blocks & Themes Options, Plugin kit, Widgets...
	+ The theme using Gutenberg
	+ I could make the blocks on Page look more cool and have previews too. I did not build because that is take more time and not is the real website so we do not need care much!
	+ The twitter & face book I could build my self using API but we need times to style and testing while these plugins are good and compatible with the design. So I used them.


Thank you for the challenge!
